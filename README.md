# Serverless-Web-Application
Deploying a Serverless Web Application on AWS Using S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFront

Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of all the steps for deploying a serverless web application using AWS services like S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFront:

---

## **Steps for Deploying a Serverless Web Application on AWS**

### **1. Setting up an S3 Bucket**
Weâ€™ll create an Amazon S3 bucket to host all of the static files for the web application, such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **What is S3?** S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an AWS service for storing files.
- **Why use S3?** Itâ€™s perfect for hosting static websites because itâ€™s scalable and cost-effective.

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to the **S3** service in AWS.
2. Click **Create Bucket** and give your bucket a unique name.
3. Upload your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the bucket.
4. Enable **Static Website Hosting** in the bucket settings.

### **2. Configuring API Gateway**
Weâ€™ll set up API Gateway to handle the API requests that will interact with our database. This will allow us to send and receive data between our web application and the backend.
- **What is API Gateway?** Itâ€™s a service that lets you create and manage APIs.
- **Why use API Gateway?** It allows us to trigger **Lambda functions** using API requests, so our app can interact with a database (DynamoDB).

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **API Gateway** in AWS and create a new **REST API**.
2. Define **GET** and **POST** methods.
   - **GET** method will retrieve data from the database.
   - **POST** method will add new data to the database.
3. Link these methods to Lambda functions that perform the actual database interactions.

### **3. Creating Lambda Functions**
Weâ€™ll write Python-based Lambda functions that handle our application logic, such as retrieving data from DynamoDB and inserting new data into it.
- **What is Lambda?** Itâ€™s a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events (like API requests).
- **Why use Lambda?** It eliminates the need to manage servers, making our application completely serverless.

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **Lambda** in AWS and create a function.
2. Write your function code to:
   - **GET**: Fetch data from the DynamoDB table.
   - **POST**: Add new data to the DynamoDB table.
3. Set up the Lambda function to respond to the **API Gateway** requests created earlier.

### **4. Working with DynamoDB**
Weâ€™ll set up a DynamoDB table to store and manage our applicationâ€™s data (e.g., user records, product information).
- **What is DynamoDB?** Itâ€™s a NoSQL database that automatically scales and offers low-latency data access.
- **Why use DynamoDB?** Itâ€™s fully managed and highly scalable, perfect for serverless applications.

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **DynamoDB** in AWS and create a new table.
   - Define a **primary key** (e.g., `studentid`).
2. Use Lambda functions to perform **CRUD** operations:
   - **Create**: Add new data to the table.
   - **Read**: Retrieve data from the table.
   - **Update**: Modify existing data in the table.
   - **Delete**: Remove data from the table.

### **5. Implementing Secure Connections with CloudFront**
Weâ€™ll use CloudFront to serve our S3 content through a secure **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, ensuring fast and secure delivery of the web content to users.
- **What is CloudFront?** Itâ€™s a global CDN service that speeds up the delivery of your web content.
- **Why use CloudFront?** It improves the performance and security of your website by serving content over **HTTPS** and caching it closer to the users.

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **CloudFront** in AWS and create a new **distribution**.
2. Set the **origin** as your S3 bucket.
3. Enable **HTTPS** to secure the content delivery.
4. Deploy the CloudFront distribution to make your website fast and secure for users around the world.

---

### **Final Overview:**
By following these steps, youâ€™ll have:
- **S3** for hosting your static web content.
- **API Gateway** to handle API requests.
- **Lambda** for running the backend logic.
- **DynamoDB** for managing your data.
- **CloudFront** to serve your web app securely and quickly.

This setup is fully serverless, meaning you donâ€™t need to manage any serversâ€”AWS takes care of everything! ðŸŽ‰
